    <p> <p style="font-family:trebuchet MS">My name is Adviti Bhanja. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio on July 7th 2002. My parents' names are Partha Bhanja and Ritu Budhraja. I have one younger brother named Abhimanyu. Growing up in an Indian household, I learned how to speak Hindi at a young age in order to communicate with my grandparents. Some of my favorite TV shows as a child were the Amazing World of Gumball and Gravity Falls. When I turned 12, my family moved to Forsyth county in Georgia. I finished the rest of 7th and 8th grade at Riverwatch Middle School. In high school I participated in the swim team, HOSA, LEO Club, and National Honor Society. In 2020 I graduated from Lambert High School and went on to pursue a communication sciences and disorders major at the University of Georgia. </p>

    <h1 style="font-family:Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, cursive">Quarantine</h1>
    <p>
   	 <p style="font-family:trebuchet MS">    At the time, Corona rates were at an all time high and as a result of that I spent the end of my senior year at home wondering if I would even make it to Athens in the fall.
Over Quarantine, I spent my mornings doing yoga before taking endlessly long walks around my neighborhood. After that I would make the usual whipped coffee with my breakfast and finish doing any homework that needed to be completed. Once finished, I would have pretty much the whole day to myself. So often I would go fishing with my friends, drive to Lake Lanier, or start an art project. At the time I was constantly on TikTok or binging through Netflix shows. Some of my favorite shows to watch were Euphoria, Outerbanks, and OITNB.
